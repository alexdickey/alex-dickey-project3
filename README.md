## Project WriteUp

1. What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
   1. Timing - I gave myself 5 full working days to pull starter code, understand the requirements, design my architecure, create my server, API's, integrate FE and BE, style everything, run tests, and deploy. I am pleased with my product.
   2. Styling - I am still unfamiliar with services such as Bootsrap to help with styling. It was the last thing I did with this project, and would have liked to have done more. 
2. Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
   1. With more time I would be able to add more functionality as well as make the application look more polished.
   2. The ability to create a profile icon, like posts, display status updates in a certain order (most liked, most recent, oldest, etc.)
3. What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
   1. I assumed that I would be able to complete it in a week, I was right with my ability to submit a working product that checks all of the boxes, but given more working time for myself, I know I could have done more. 
4. How long did this assignment take to complete?
   1. Overall, this assignment took me somewhere around 30 working hours.
